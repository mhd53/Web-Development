 Used styled components for most of the styling.
 
 <p>
 
 **Styled Container** has been heavily used. It's a div with lots of predefined props to avoid using and *.css* files.
 It includes cool features like *centerX* and *centerY* which will enable element centering to occure with ease. 
 
 To achieve div centering a comination of width: auto & margin: auto has been used with **Styled Container**.

 **GOOD LUCK TO US ALL :D**
